Assumptions Being Made**  \n1. The request is to **attach a wall to the base** and have it **perpendicular** to the base.  \n   - \"Attached\" means direct contact with the base.  \n   - \"Perpendicular\" means the wall should stand at a **90-degree angle** relative to the base.  \n\n2. **No position for the wall is specified** (e.g., left, right, front, back).  \n   - A reasonable assumption is to place it **along one of the edges** of the base.  \n   - The **X-direction** is chosen arbitrarily for consistency.  \n\n3. **The wall's thickness is not specified**, but we assume it follows a reasonable default.  \n   - Since the previous cuboid-like structures used `cuboid_thickness=5`, we maintain that.  \n\n4. **The height of the wall is unspecified**, so we assume a logical default.  \n   - Based on the original module, we assume a height of **50**.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Positioning, Size, and Orientation**  \n1. **Base Positioning**  \n   - The base spans `100 x 100` in the XY plane with a thickness of `1`, and it's centered at the origin.  \n\n2. **Wall Size**  \n   - The **height** of the wall is assumed to be `50`.  \n   - The **thickness** is assumed to be `5`.  \n   - The **width** of the wall matches the **size_y of the base** (`100`), so it spans across the full width.  \n\n3. **Wall Placement**  \n   - The wall should be positioned **along the right edge** of the base.  \n   - Since the base is centered at the origin, its right edge is at `x = 50`.  \n   - The wall is centered on this edge, meaning we must **offset it by half of its thickness** (`5/2 = 2.5`).  \n   - Its **Z-position** is set so that its bottom aligns with the base, meaning its center is at `z = height/2 = 25`.  \n\n---\n\n```openscad\n// Base plane\ncube([100, 100, 1], center=true);\n\n// Perpendicular wall along the right edge\ntranslate([50 - 2.5, 0, 25])\n    cube([5, 100, 50], center=true);\n```"}]}
