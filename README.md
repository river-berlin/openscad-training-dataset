# openscad-training-dataset
A refined training dataset for openscad projects - with a focus on BOSL2


## Current list of ideas with checkmarks

1. [] - Manual labelling, and creating the dataset (in progress)
2. [] - Fine tuning a model on (1) as I am working on it, so that my future progress becomes faster
3. [] - Expanding orientations and using a large language model to create combinations of how to do things on the existing dataset
